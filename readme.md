# Reddit To Video
Reddit to video is a script that scrapes reddit for posts and / or comments, compiling them into those horrible videos you see on YouTube and TikTok!

## Why?
I thought it would be interesting...

## How to use
Stay tuned!

## Can I speed up the export?
At the moment, besides increasing the threads or lowering the bitrate / fps in the config, not really.

# Text To Speech
The current options for text to speech at the moment are: your systems, and google translates tts api. These may be expanded upon in the future, however and the current moment, these will be primarily focused going forward.

## How do I change my system voice?
Run main.py with the flag -sv to see a list of your available system voices. From there, copy the ID and set it to the voice value in the TTS json key

## AI generated text
Sadly I do not have any experience with AI models and ML, however if anyone does and would like to contribute that to this project then I would be more than happy to do that!
