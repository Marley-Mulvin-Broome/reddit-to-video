# Reddit To Video
Reddit to video is a script that scrapes reddit for posts and / or comments, compiling them into those horrible videos you see on YouTube and TikTok!

## Why?
I thought it would be interesting...

## How to use
Stay tuned!

## Can I speed up the export?
At the moment, besides increasing the threads or lowering the bitrate / fps in the config, not really.
